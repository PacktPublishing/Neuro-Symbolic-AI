# Neuro-Symbolic AI
This is the official GitHub repository for the book "Neuro-Symbolic AI" published by Packt. This repository contains all the material required to follow and replicate the content discussed in Chapter 8.

# About the Book
Neuro-Symbolic AI has become an increasingly critical area of study, as it seeks to bridge the gap between human-like understanding and machine learning capabilities. Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) has often struggled to grasp the nuances and complexities of human cognition, which is where Neuro-Symbolic AI comes into play. By combining the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning, this groundbreaking approach aims to design systems that understand the world as we do. 

The main areas of focus in this book are as follows: 

• The history and limitations of traditional AI 

• The origins and evolution of symbolic AI and neural networks 

• The principles and foundation of Neuro-Symbolic AI 

• Practical applications and programming techniques for Neuro-Symbolic AI 

• The need for explainable systems and the Future of AI 

In this book, we will take you on a journey through the evolution of AI. We will delve into the rise and fall of symbolic AI, followed by the neural networks revolution. Our exploration will then lead us to the exciting intersection of these two domains, as we introduce Neuro-Symbolic AI as the next level of AI. Through the book, we aim to offer you a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the field of Neuro-Symbolic AI, as well as a practical guide to implementing some of these concepts in Python. We will also discuss the importance of explainable AI and the exciting future developments that await us. Rather than focusing solely on theoretical concepts, our book presents a balanced blend of theory, practical applications, and real-world examples. By using accessible language and detailed illustrations, we hope to make the topic engaging and approachable for both beginners and experienced AI enthusiasts alike. 

Embark on this fascinating journey with us, and uncover the potential of Neuro-Symbolic AI to revolutionize the way we interact with intelligent systems. Let's explore how we can design systems that truly understand the world as we do, and reshape the future of AI together. 

# Getting Started
To get started with the code examples in the book, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to have the following libraries installed:

• numpy
• pandas
• matplotlib
• scikit-learn
• torch
• ltn (LTNtorch)

The ltn package can be installed through pip as follows:

`pip install LTNtorch`

To run the code examples, you can open the Jupyter notebook in this repository using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. You can then execute the code cells within the notebooks to see the results.

Alternatively, you can upload the notebook to Google Colab and run everything from their. Please note that if you are using a GPU to run your code, you might need to make some minor code changes to enable GPU support. Google Colab is recommended for begineers since it provides a pre-installed environment out-of-the-box.
